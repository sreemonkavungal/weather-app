# weather-app
This application was built using HTML and jQuery, and allows users to check the current weather conditions for any city in the world.
When you open the app, you'll see a simple and user-friendly interface that prompts you to enter the name of the city you want to check. Once you enter the city name and click the "Search" button, the app will display the current temperature, humidity and climate.
To build this app, I used the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data for each city. I used jQuery to make AJAX requests to the API and parse the JSON response data, and then used HTML and CSS to display the data in a clear and concise way.
